      You can either override this partial by placing a file with the same name
      in the same path ( Rails.root/app/views/video_ splitter/application/_form.html.erb )
      of your host application (in this case you'll conserve the collapsible accordion behavior),
      or override the whole _output_file.html.erb partial in the same way.
